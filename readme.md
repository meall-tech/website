# Minimal Personal Website + Portfolio Astro Theme

## About

This is the Minimal Personal Website + Portfolio template for Astro!

This is the same template I use for my personal website! You can use it to build a personal website and portfolio that suits your needs! Read below to learn how to use this as a tempale for your own personal website!

## Using this as a template

Want to create your own website from this template? Click `Use this template` to get started! This is an theme that has been verified by Astro (the framework used to built my website) as a theme. You can find the posting [here](https://astro.build/themes/details/minimal-personal-website-portfolio/).

Once you've copied the code via the use template button and cloned your copy of the template locally, you can get started by running `npm install`. This will install the dependencies (you only need to do this once). Next, run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

Now, you can edit the json files in src/content/data to customize the template with your own information. Make sure to update each file in src/content/data accordingly. Make sure to update the site's domain in `astro.config.mjs` to your website's domain as well.

Make sure to delete `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` if you don't want your site deployed to Github pages.

Please open an issue [here](https://github.com/raspberri05/website/issues) if you are having any trouble with using this repository as a template and I can try my best to help resolve the issue.

## Want new features in this template?

Please open an issue that explains the feature request in detail or pull request adding the feature on the template repository (not your copy of the template)!
